      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I picked up an interest in programming at a fairly young age, and something that started out as a simple hobby has grown into a passion that I have happily embraced. In the future, I hope to turn that passion into a career.<br><br>
        Outside of school and work, my hobbies included reading, writing, and playing guitar. </p>
